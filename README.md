## Getting Started

### Access to GitHub Package Registry
Since we use dependencies inherent in GPR,
then one must set up access to the GPR with a PAT (personal access token)
which has `read:packages`.
You can [create PAT here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
If you have a PAT that you use to access maven packages in GitHub, you can reuse this.
In your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`, set the following environment variable:

`export NPM_AUTH_TOKEN=<your PAT with read:packages>`

### install yarn
Yarn can be installed through the npm package manager, with this command: 
```npm install --global yarn```

The following steps need to be in the project directory(the root foler for this app), you can run:

### Install all the dependencies
```bash
yarn
```

### Builds the app for production
```bash
yarn build
```

### Run the app in development mode

```bash
yarn dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000/ to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Creating a docker image
Creating a docker image should be as simple as `docker build -t macgyver-frontend .`

### Running a docker image
`docker run --rm -it -p 3000:3000 macgyver-frontend`
